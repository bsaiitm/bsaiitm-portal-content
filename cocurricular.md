## iGEM Competition
iGEM or International Genetically Engineered Machine is an international competition started by MIT in 2004. It happens every year and the latest 2017 edition saw 310 teams participating from across the world. IITM has been participating since 2008 and we have won 3 gold medals and 4 silver medals!
